OpenLayers Button Generator
===========================

This is a small script that helps to generate custom colored images used in 
OpenLayers.

The script depends (obviously) on Python and on the presence of Inkscape 
(http://inkscape.org/) and is tested on Ubuntu-flavored Linux. 

See here the autogenerated documentation ``generateButtons.html`` or [this 
German blog post](http://www.terrestris.de/2009/07/27/opensource-hilfsscript-zum-umfarben-und-restylen-der-openlayers-buttons-openlayersbuttongenerator/)
for information and usage help.
